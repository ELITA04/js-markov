# simple-markov-chain
A JavaScript library to help you create Markov Chains

---

## :beginner: Introduction

Markov Chains are very powerful, in fact, they are sometimes used in predicting the weather :cloud: or even generating sentences and words :pencil2:

Some odd uses for Markov Chains are:

* Hashing algoriths and cryptographic keys :key:

* Some sites use Markov Chains to grade how likely a person will open the link

* Baby name generators may use Markov Chains

* [This JavaScript Repo Name generator](https://mrsharpoblunto.github.io/foswig.js/) uses a Markov Chain

## :clock3: More to come!
